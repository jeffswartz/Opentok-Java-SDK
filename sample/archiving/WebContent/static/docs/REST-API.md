OpenTok 2.0 Archiving REST API
==============================

The OpenTok 2.0 archiving feature lets you record OpenTok 2.0 sessions.

This API only works with OpenTok 2.0 sessions. OpenTok 1.0 sessions are not supported.

*Note:* This documentation is a preview of the OpenTok 2.0 beta archiving REST API.

When you record an archive of a session, the resulting video is an H.264-encoded MP4 file, available for download.

The REST APIs include functions for the following:

* [Starting an archive recording](#start_archive)
* [Stopping an archive recording](#stop_archive)
* [Listing archives](#listing_archives)
* [Retrieving archive information](#retrieve_archive_info)
* [Deleting an archive](#delete_archive)
* [Notification of archive status changes](#notification_status_change)
* [Listing notification callbacks](#list_callbacks)
* [Deleting a notification callback](#delete_callback)

## Starting an archive recording

To start recording an archive of an OpenTok 2.0 session, submit an HTTP POST request.

Clients must be actively connected to the OpenTok session for you to successfully start recording an archive.

You can only record one archive at a time for a given session. You can only record archives of OpenTok server-enabled
sessions; you cannot archive peer-to-peer sessions.

### HTTP POST to archive

Submit an HTTP POST request to the following URL:

    https://api.opentok.com/v2/partner/<api_key>/archive/

Replace `<api_key>` with your OpenTok API key. See <https://dashboard.tokbox.com>.

#### POST header properties

API calls must be authenticated using a custom HTTP header: X-TB-PARTNER-AUTH. Send your API key and API secret concatenated with a colon:

    X-TB-PARTNER-AUTH: <api_key>:<api_secret>

(See <https://dashboard.tokbox.com>.)

Set the Content-type header to application/json:

    Content-Type:application/json

#### POST data

Include a JSON object of the following form as the POST data:

    {
        "sessionId" : "session_id",
        "action" : "start",
        "name" : "archive_name"
    }

The JSON object includes the following properties:

* `sessionId` -- The session ID of the OpenTok session you want to start archiving
* `action` -- Set this to "start". (This is case-sensitive.)
* `name` -- (Optional) The name of the archive (for your own identification)

### Response

The raw data of the HTTP response, with status code 200, is a JSON-encoded message of the following form:

The JSON object includes an array of objects defining each callback. Each callback object contains the following properties:

* id -- The unique ID for the registered callback. Use this ID to delete a callback, using the DELETE method.
(See [Deleting a notification callback](#delete_callback).)
* url -- The callback URL.
* event -- This is set to "status" for archiving callbacks. In addition to archiving callbacks, this JSON object lists
any other OpenTok callbacks you have registered (for example, for [OpenTok Cloud Raptor](http://labs.opentok.com/raptor).)
* group -- This is set to "archive" for archiving callbacks.
* createdAt -- The time when the callback registration was created.
* updatedAt -- The time when the callback registration was last modified.

The OpenTok server returns a 403 status code if you send an invalid API key or API secret.

### Example

The following command line example retrieves information about registered callbacks:

    api_key=12345
    api_secret=234567890
    curl \
        -i \
        -X GET \
        -H "X-TB-PARTNER-AUTH:$api_key:$api_secret" \
        https://api.opentok.com/v2/partner/$api_key/callback

Set the values for `api_key` and `api_secret` to the API key and partner secret provided to you when you signed up for
an OpenTok account.


<a name="delete_callback"></a>

## Deleting a notification callback
You can delete a notification callback URLs you've registered by submitting an HTTP DELETE request.

### HTTP DELETE to callback

Submit an HTTP DELETE request to the following URL:

    https://api.opentok.com/v2/partner/<api_key>/callback/<callback_id>

Replace `<callback_id>` with the ID of the registered callback. See
[Notification of archive status changes](#notification_status_change) and [Listing notification callback URLs](#list_callbacks).

Replace `<api_key>` with your OpenTok API key. See <https://dashboard.tokbox.com>.

#### DELETE header properties

API calls must be authenticated using a custom HTTP header: X-TB-PARTNER-AUTH. Send your API key and API secret concatenated with a colon:

    X-TB-PARTNER-AUTH: <api_key>:<api_secret>

(See <https://dashboard.tokbox.com>.)

### Response

The OpenTok server returns a 204 status code upon successfully deleting the callback.
